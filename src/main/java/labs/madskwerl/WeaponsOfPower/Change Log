Created Change Log
Canceled HOTBAR_MOVE_AND_READD and HOTBAR_SWAP Events. To avoid de-stacking the charges artifact during these events
Also removed cleanChargesArtifact method in nsa and it's related delay call object, which was called when hotbar swapping
Removed Inventory Artifact. With future inv swapping mechanics it will not be necessary
Implemented respawning charges artifact in inv on death via player death player respawn and a few changes to player led

09/21/19 JES
Updated implemented comments on powers up to 12.
Note Error Msg's spotted on death when Cause is charity sword. TODO

09/22/2019 JES
added generate power up to powers class for implemented powers
removed getMagnitude() from powers.
    -power magnitude will either be 1 (positive powerID) or 5 (negative PowerID).
    -Inf (powerID = 0) has no +5 magnitude, it just gives infinite ammo
    - powerID = -1 (wop of power id) will never be a power up (meaning -1 is ammo regen +5 in this context)


TODO:
powerup spawner:
overloaded:
takes either a location to spawn in world
or
an entity to spawn a powerup in inv

add command to utilize spawner

09/23/2019 JES

added the toggleMobsDropPowerUp command (unimplemented)
Added add and remove powerups to led (cleared default power up inventory)
Crouching (inv swap is now bugged)
added overload spawn powerup methods to nsa (not used atm)

wop rm (remove all) needs to be debugged. Looks like an exception is hit (removes wop in hand and displays syntax)
wop X -Y spawns wop with no ammo - +Y works fine (all neg wops = no ammo if just x is used)
added healing power to wopData
no ammo bug fixed itself?
fixed wop rm

timer not firing b/c wop.entityisplayer no set when creating wop (wopdata needed to use method rather then directly setting the entity

fixed neg regen not going all the way to 0 ammo
